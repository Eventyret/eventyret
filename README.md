# 🧙‍♂️ Eventyret [:heart: Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/Eventyret)

**`Senior Software Engineer • T-Shaped Developer • Creator of Almost Done`**

Hey there — I'm **Simen**, aka **Eventyret** (yes, like a fairytale). I'm a Senior Software Engineer on the platform team at [Sema4.ai](https://sema4.ai), where I work on the backend infrastructure and DevOps that powers their enterprise AI agent platform.

But here's the thing about me: **I think code should be fun, collaborative, and a little bit magical.** I love diving deep into complex technical problems, mentoring other developers, and building the robust systems that make other people's brilliant ideas actually work. Also, I have strong opinions about terminal setups and will absolutely geek out about Docker optimization with you.

## 🧵 My Side Quest: Almost Done

While building platform infrastructure for enterprise AI agents by day, I also created and run [**Almost Done**](https://almostdone.news) — a weekly newsletter for neurodivergent developers. What started as "maybe I should write about my chaotic dev process" has grown into a community of 500+ developers who celebrate creative problem-solving and build systems that actually work with their brains.

**The tech behind it**: Next.js, PayloadCMS, TypeScript, Docker — because even side projects deserve good architecture.

**Why it matters**: It turns out a lot of developers think in beautiful, non-linear ways. Some of our best solutions come from those weird tangents everyone tells you to avoid.

## 🧰 How I Build Things

I'm a **T-shaped generalist** who loves getting deep into **backend systems**, **DevOps**, **Docker**, and **platform engineering**. But honestly? I'm happiest when there's a gnarly infrastructure problem to solve, a terminal to work in, and maybe a good dad joke to share along the way.

### 🧠 My Technical Philosophy

**Frameworks are tools, not religions.** I choose tech based on what solves the actual problem, not what looks good on a resume.

**Infrastructure should be invisible.** If the platform team is doing our job right, the developers building on top of it shouldn't have to think about it.

**Embrace the tangents.** Some of my best solutions have come from those "wait, what if we..." moments that good engineering managers pretend to discourage but secretly love.

**Community > competition.** The best code happens when diverse minds collaborate. That's why I spend time mentoring, writing, and building spaces for developers who think differently.

## 📜 The Adventure So Far

Once upon a localhost, I started as a freelance dev under **DigitalFairytales** (later **Fairytales.dev**). The fairytale theme wasn't just cute branding — it was hope. Every project felt like an adventure where the ending wasn't guaranteed, but the journey was always worth it.

Since then, my quest log includes:

- 🧑‍🏫 **Mentored 100+ developers** at Code Institute, helping career changers navigate their first steps in tech
- 🐋 **Architected containerized solutions** (sometimes over-engineered, but hey, they were beautifully over-engineered)
- 🌟 Earned **Strapi Community Star** recognition for being helpful and only slightly chaotic
- 🛠️ Built **platform infrastructure** at [Sema4.ai](https://sema4.ai) that powers enterprise AI agent workflows at scale
- 🧵 Grew [**Almost Done**](https://almostdone.news) from zero to 500+ subscribers who appreciate creative chaos

**Plot twist**: Learning that my ADHD brain's "creative tangents" aren't bugs to fix — they're features to leverage. Those weird detours often lead to the most elegant solutions.

> _"Some of the best code comes from the weirdest tangents."_ — A lesson learned from years of "quick fixes" that became breakthrough features.

### 💼 What I'm Really Good At

- **Platform Engineering**: Building the reliable infrastructure that lets other developers focus on the fun stuff
- **Backend Systems**: Creating scalable, maintainable server-side architectures
- **DevOps & CI/CD**: Making deployment and operations something you don't dread
- **Containerization**: Docker, orchestration, and making things run consistently everywhere
- **Mentoring**: Helping developers level up without burning out
- **Community Building**: Creating spaces where different kinds of minds can thrive
